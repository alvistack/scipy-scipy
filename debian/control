Description: Scientific Library for Python
 SciPy (pronounced "Sigh Pie") is open-source software for mathematics,
 science, and engineering. The SciPy library depends on NumPy, which
 provides convenient and fast N-dimensional array manipulation. The SciPy
 library is built to work with NumPy arrays, and provides many
 user-friendly and efficient numerical routines such as routines for
 numerical integration and optimization. Together, they run on all
 popular operating systems, are quick to install, and are free of charge.
 NumPy and SciPy are easy to use, but powerful enough to be depended upon
 by some of the worldâ€™s leading scientists and engineers. If you need to
 manipulate numbers on a computer and display or publish the results,
 give SciPy a try!
